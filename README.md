# Firewall Realtime Detection

This project implements a real-time detection system for monitoring and analyzing network traffic to identify potential security threats. Below, you'll find detailed explanations of the code structure, its functionality, and step-by-step instructions for setting up the project.

## Features

- **Real-time Monitoring**: Continuously monitors network traffic to detect anomalies.
- **Threat Detection**: Uses predefined rules or machine learning models to identify suspicious activities.
- **Logging**: Maintains detailed logs of detected threats for analysis.
- **Customizable Rules**: Allows users to define and modify detection rules as per their requirements.
- **Alerts**: Sends notifications (e.g., email, SMS) when threats are detected.

## Code Structure

### 1. `main.py`
This is the entry point of the application. It initializes the detection system, loads configuration files, and starts monitoring network traffic. The script also handles exceptions and ensures the system runs continuously.

### 2. `config/rules.json`
This file contains the detection rules. Each rule specifies patterns or conditions to identify potential threats. Rules can be based on IP addresses, ports, protocols, or custom conditions.

### 3. `config/alerts.json`
This file defines the alert settings, such as the type of notifications to send and the recipients. It supports multiple notification channels, including email, SMS, and webhook integrations.

### 4. `detector.py`
This module contains the logic for analyzing network traffic and applying detection rules. It uses efficient algorithms to process large volumes of data in real-time and supports integration with machine learning models for advanced threat detection.

### 5. `logger.py`
Handles logging of detected threats, including timestamps, threat details, and severity levels. Logs are stored in a structured format to facilitate easy analysis and integration with external tools like SIEM systems.

### 6. `notifier.py`
Manages the alerting system, sending notifications when a threat is detected. It supports multiple notification methods and ensures reliable delivery of alerts.

### 7. `requirements.txt`
Lists all the Python dependencies required to run the project. Dependencies include libraries for network traffic analysis, logging, and notification handling.

### 8. `logs/`
A directory where all logs are stored. Each log entry includes details about detected threats, such as the source and destination IPs, timestamps, and rule violations.

## Installation

Follow these steps to set up the project:

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/firewall-realtime-detection.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd firewall-realtime-detection
    ```

3. Install the required dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4. Verify the installation:
    ```bash
    python --version
    pip list
    ```

## Usage

1. Start the detection system:
    ```bash
    python main.py
    ```

2. Configure detection rules:
    - Open `config/rules.json`.
    - Add or modify rules based on your requirements.

3. Configure alert settings:
    - Open `config/alerts.json`.
    - Specify the notification type (e.g., email) and recipient details.

4. View logs:
    - Navigate to the `logs/` directory to review detected threats.

5. Test the system:
    - Simulate network traffic to verify that the detection rules and alerts are working as expected.

## Configuration

### Rules
- Define detection rules in `config/rules.json`.
- Example rule:
    ```json
    {
        "rule_name": "Suspicious IP",
        "condition": "source_ip == '192.168.1.100'",
        "action": "alert"
    }
    ```

### Alerts
- Configure alert settings in `config/alerts.json`.
- Example configuration:
    ```json
    {
        "email": {
            "enabled": true,
            "recipients": ["admin@example.com"]
        },
        "sms": {
            "enabled": false,
            "recipients": []
        }
    }
    ```

## Testing

1. Unit Tests:
    - Run unit tests to ensure individual modules work as expected:
        ```bash
        pytest tests/
        ```

2. Integration Tests:
    - Test the entire system by simulating network traffic and verifying detection and alerting.

3. Performance Tests:
    - Measure the system's performance under high traffic loads to ensure scalability.
